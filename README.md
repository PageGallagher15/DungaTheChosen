# DungaTheChosen

Capstone 2019 : Humber College

///About///

This was a game a group of friends and i had made for our capstone, to close out our Game Programming course at Humber College in Toronto Ontario. 

The main idea of this game was to implement UI manipulation, with the main objective of the game to move things around in the world and keep your "deciple" alive. 

You are essentially a viking god tasked with the problem of keeping a very idiotic and dumbfounded villager named "Dunga" alive in anyway you can. Whether that be switching the health bars with the enemies, or grabbing and shooting the arrows back at the archers. 

We particapated in Level Up TO this year showing off this game to people and they generally seemed to love it. 

///Role///

My role in the development of this game was shaders and general bug fixes and adding small details to the code when necessary. As well as just general programming jobs. 

///Learning///

What i learned most about this was team work and working with people on a programming project together. I also learned more about Unity and certain little quirks it has on offer. 

This code example, can exemplify just a few of my personal skill sets in the realm of coding.
